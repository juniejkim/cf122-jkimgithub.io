The Oscar-nominated film "Parasite" by Bong Joon Ho expertly and voyeuristically investigates social differences in Korea. It becomes a tragicomic exercise in the futility of striving to watch the impoverished family leave their claustrophobic semi-basement home and pass the wealthy family's lavish mansion. First, the lighting reflects the gap between the rich and poor through the lighting. The large windows throughout the wealthy mansion's high-ground location let light stream in throughout the whole day when the sun is up. However, there is only a brief window in the semi-basement dwelling that lets in sunshine, and it only does so briefly during the day. The size of the tiny window and the sunlit area are both constrained. The lighting in Park's home was "aesthetic lighting," whereas the lighting in the semi-basement was "technical lighting." However, there were sequences with stairs in the majority of the transitions between other locations. Between the two polar opposites of spaces and relationships, stairs serve as crucial transitions. After indulging in the fleeting "highness," stairs can serve as a tool for bringing one's genuine identity into focus. The characters enthusiastically approach but then sprint endlessly away in the heavy rain. At the bottom of the steps, they discover their home under water.
